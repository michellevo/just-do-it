var corpus="Do it. Just do it. Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday, you said tomorrow, so just do it. Make your dreams come true, just do it. Some people dream of success, while youre gonna wake up and work hard at it. Nothing is impossible. You should get to the point where anyone else would quit, and youre not going to stop there. No, what are you waiting for? DO IT. Just do it. Yes, you can. Just do it. If youre tired of starting over, stop giving up."
